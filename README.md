# Skeet source code

- Remember to create you own branch out of main before working
- Don't change anything on main. This is the template we will use for each design
- We will have multiple branchs as we work on different designs so lets follow this <br> pattern for branch name: {design name}-{design type}-{your name}. This current <br> project my branch would be name: `message-mediator-ara`. That will help us to <br> to know to which project the branch is from, what type, and who owns it.
